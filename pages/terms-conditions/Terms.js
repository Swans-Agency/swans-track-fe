          unenforceable. The validity of the remainder of these Terms of Service
          is not affected.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-[1.5rem] font-bold pt-4">Entire Agreement</h3>
        <p>
          These Terms of Service and any policies or operating rules posted by
          us on the website or with respect to the website constitute the entire
          agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to
          exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service
          shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms
          of Service operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may
          assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any time.
          We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or
          failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Service is
          determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or
          part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Service
          and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
          provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment, or
          agency relationship created between you and us as a result of these
          Terms of Service or use of the website. You agree that these Terms of
          Service will not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted
          them. You hereby waive any and all defences you may have based on the
          electronic form of these Terms of Service and the lack of signing by
          the parties hereto to execute these Terms of Service.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-[1.5rem] font-bold pt-4">Governing Law</h3>
